# DiveIn
An application that can be used to generate event scores for fictitious competitions

This app was created for fictitious high-dive events so it is pre-loaded with various dives but can be reconfigured for any event by editing the DifficultyTable1mS file.
This repository also contains command line programs for single and team based competition.

The DiveIn file is the gui application while PeopleScorer and TeamScorer are the command line applications.
